# Password-generator
This project is a password generator.  This code will create a strong random password you can use when you need a password.

## What makes a strong password?
According to Mircosoft support, a strong password consists of:
- At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better.
- A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.
- Significantly different from your previous passwords.

## Personal reflection
💭 **Process:** A small project thus it didn't take long to set up the project and finish it.  Therefore, I just sat down for an afternoon and got started.

📚 **Learnings:** A good first project to pratice github and getting an understanding of how it works plus extra pratice with python and the random module.

⭐ **Improvement:** Future improvements would include adding an input option for a user to choose length of password.

🚦 **Running the project:** Using the code in the code file and running it.  There is already a test case within the file "print(PassGen())".

📸 **Result:** Here are some example passwords created by the algorhitim
- tr#qU50d@#Hl
- j9n5a!!!e!&*
- cOH9m#!#!9#x
